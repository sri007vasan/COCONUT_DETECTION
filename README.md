# COCONUT MATURITY DETECTION USING OPEN CV

So this project basically , helps in finding the maturity of a coconut by making a colour classification,The OPEN CV library is used in this project's implementation inorder to classify the coconut based upon the colour of the coconut.

This entire simuation is done in the software called WEBOTs

ensure the file locations are kept correctly
#initially when you install the webots you will be have a cfile for the drone control and .exe file please delete that and create a python file in the controllers folder of the mavic2pro
#initialise the google cloud setup on your own use to store the output in google sheets the code for that also is given, please make sure you have given your sheet's correct google sheet's id and also your sheet's name.
#so this is how it works
- operate the drone by normal up,dowm and side arrow keys , if you press shift along with it then the drone will go up and down.
- if you click "P" then the drone's camera will take a snap and it will be stored in your computer's specified folder(ensure you have given a correct folder name)
- then ensure the google sheet connection to the cloud using google cloud tool to store the ouput for future use and analysis purposes.
that's all about  the project
